Problem Statement:

One part of our day-to-day operations is to on-board a lot of cooks to ensure we have enough supply. After we on-board them, we assign a category and a rating to them after judging them on their skills. Once the on-boarding is done, we match these on-boarded cooks as per the customer queries we receive.

  

We want you to create an automated system that can help us easily on-board the cooks. All the data should be directly stored in the database in the attached format.

 

The platform that you create should be able to do below tasks:

 

1.    On-board cooks and enter all their relevant information in attached format.

2.    Ability to edit and modify the existing records

3.  A query mechanism to filter cooks based on customer’s preferences – mainly, location and preferred time slots. Other parameters can be added to the query later on.

4.    A system to generate profiles of the cooks and show them to the Customer Request team.
